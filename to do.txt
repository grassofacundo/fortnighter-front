I should stop thinking like I know the usual "start time", I just know the timeframe for a regular pay.
I should set the double date in the shift only after the shift information, but not beforehand.
The day in the shift is the day in which the person starts working, if the person works overnight, I should add the second date in the shift section.

Think about shared days shifts (ex, start at night and finished at the next day)
