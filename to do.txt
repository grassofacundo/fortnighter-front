BREAKING!! overtime and overwork may not be two different things, is all overtime. I should think about that. Can I get the length of the work time from the start and end? In that case, the job text will be way shorter and simpler. Any overtime is always the same price? It should be.

    - General testing.

Get the job position from DB and pre fill the hour price text-form in the update section:
- Regular is working, not the rest
- Handle changing the values when switching from regular to any other workday type

Form:
- Add focus on time dropdown
- Fix key input on time
